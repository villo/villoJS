 * Villo Bridge allows for accelerated Villo development, giving developers a plug-in method for viewing Villo content.
 * ------------
 * Villo Bridge is currently Enyo-only, and uses a custom enyo-kind, set up to your specifications.
 * UPDATE: As of September 24th, the below is no longer true.
 * Bridge also is using the 1.0 (or 1.x, pending a final decision) specification for callbacks, passing a callback object as a separate object, and providing onSuccess and onFailure callbacks. 
 * The 1.0 specification also supports calling the callbacks based on the server response, by passing "specify: true".
