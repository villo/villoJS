<h1><a name="villo.ajax">villo.ajax</a></h1>

<p>Cross-platform, cross-browser Ajax function. This is used by Villo to connect to the Villo APIs.</p>

<h2>Calling</h2>

<p><code><a href="source_utils_ajax.js.html#villo.ajax">villo.ajax</a>(url, {method: string, parameters: object, onSuccess: function, onFailure: function})</code></p>

<ul>
<li>The "url" should be a string, which contains the URL (in full) of the file you wish to get through Ajax.</li>
<li>The "method" is a string which sets which method ("GET" or "POST") you wish to use when using the Ajax function.</li>
<li>The "parameters" objects sets the parameters to sent to the web service. These will be sent using the method you set in the method argument.</li>
<li>"onSuccess" is called after the Ajax request is completed. A string containing the response to the server will be passed to this function.</li>
<li>The "onFailure" function will be called if there was a problem with the Ajax request.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use</h2>

<pre><code><a href="source_utils_ajax.js.html#villo.ajax">villo.ajax</a>("http://mysite", {
    method: 'post', //You can also set this to "get".
    parameters: {
        "hello": "world"
    },
    onSuccess: function(transport){
        //The string of the response is held in the "transport" variable!
    },
    onFailure: function(err){
        //Something went wrong! Error code is held in the "err" variable.
    }
});
</code></pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>On most modern browsers, cross-domain Ajax requests are allowed. However, there may still be issues with the server rejecting requests from different origins.</p>

<p>Most of the Villo APIs require that your web browser supports cross-domain Ajax requests. If your browser does not support them, then you will likely not be able to use a majorty of Villo features.</p>
